        There are many different parameters
        for how the game works,
        which you can change in the settings.
        The speedrun timer displays a code
        which describes these parameters.
        The default is <code>v01-N5x10</code>.
      </p>
      <ul style={{textAlign: 'left'}}>
        <li><code>v01</code> is the version, which is currently always v01.</li>
        <li><code>N</code> is the difficulty: N for normal, H for hard, and U for ultra hard.</li>
        <li><code>5</code> is the word length.</li>
        <li><code>x10</code> is the length of the speedrun (how many wordles you have to solve).</li>
        <li><code>-a<i>XY</i></code>, if present, indicates which autoguessing features are enabled. The first digit (X) is 1 if you have "automatically press enter" turned on and 0 otherwise, and the second digit (Y) is the number of autoguesses you have.</li>
        <li><code>-d<i>X</i></code>, if present, indicates the amount of delay time after each guess, measured in 10ths of a second.</li>
        <li><code>-p<i>X</i></code>, if present, indicates the amount of penalty time added for each wrong guess, measured in 10ths of a second.</li>
      </ul>

        You get {maxGuesses} tries to guess a target word.
        <br />
        After each guess, you get Mastermind-style feedback.
